description: Features a complete Story Mode with a unique soundtrack by Jim Nopedie. Stages place a heavy focus on presenting new, inventive ideas one after another with nearly every stage introducing some new combo or usage of elements. For example, world 1 introduces uncommon mechanics such as one-way walls and icy platforms. This idea-focused approach leads to experimental level design, while maintaining the polish expected from any full custom-themed pack.
