description: Features a complete Story Mode as well as 11 stages in Master. It was one of the first packs to experiment with larger and more complex stage design, and it is well known for its long gauntlet-style stages. The pack was very well recieved by the community, and Gaiden has one of the most competitive speedrunning scenes of any custom pack! The first stage in master is a padlock puzzle, which can be completed after beating the game's story mode to unlock the pack's difficult master extra mode.
