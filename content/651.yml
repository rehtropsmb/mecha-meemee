description: This pack features a complete Story Mode with a unique soundtrack by Jim Nopedie. Stages often spin a quick challenge or clever puzzle out of some simple core concept, with a design philosophy often described as elegant and to-the-point. With an intense difficulty spike in World 10, players often recommend you finish your casual playthrough at the end of World 9 and treat World 10 as a bonus kaizo challenge to tackle after gaining much more experience.
